											No-fault divorce in England and Wales means anyone seeking
											a divorce has to establish one thing: that the marriage or
											civil partnership has broken down irretrievably. Contrary
											to fault-based systems there is no requirement for a
											person
											<a href="<?= base_url('family-solicitors'); ?>"
												>seeking a divorce</a
											>
											to blame his or her spouse or civil partner for the
											breakdown in the marriage. As a result, allegations of
											unreasonable behaviour have no place in the procedural
											aspect of securing a divorce in England and Wales.
										</p>
										<p>
											In reality however, behaviour that a spouse or civil
											partner finds unreasonable or unacceptable will very often
											be the catalyst for divorce.
										</p>
										<p>
											Before the Divorce and Dissolution Act (no-fault divorce)
											came into force in 2022, unreasonable behaviour was the
											most common ground for divorce. That doesnâ€™t mean that
											England is full of unreasonable people. Allegations of
											unreasonable behaviour under the fault-based system of
											divorce that existed before 2022 meant simply that in all
											the circumstances of the marriage, it was not reasonable
											for the person seeking a divorce to stay living with his
											or her spouse or partner.
										</p>
										<p>
											What constituted unreasonable behaviour was an entirely
											subjective matter. Some spouses or civil partners might
											feel aggrieved if their partner goes for a drink with his
											work mates before coming home every night of the working
											week; others might regard it as perfectly normal and
											acceptable.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you are thinking about beginning divorce proceedings
											you can get in touch with us for an initial, no-obligation
											discussion. No-fault divorce means that, if your spouse or
											civil partner is behaving in a way that you find
											intolerable you can apply for a divorce without having to
											formally describe the behaviour in your divorce
											application. This could make it more straightforward for
											you to reach agreement on divorce-related matters like
											finances and child arrangements.
