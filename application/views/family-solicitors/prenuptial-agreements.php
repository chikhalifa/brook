                            Pre-nuptial Agreements in England are often
                            regarded as binding though the court retains
                            discretion as to whether an agreement should be
                            enforced.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The chances of a prenup being upheld by the courts
                            are increased greatly if the agreement has been
                            entered into freely by both sides, each side
                            understands the financial implications of the
                            agreement and overall, the prenup is fair in the
                            way it provides for the economically weaker
                            spouse. Financial provision for dependent children
                            must also be factored into the agreement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A prenup can set out how you and your spouse will
                            manage your finances during the marriage. It can
                            also specify what you expect to happen should
                            either of you die – although you must make a will
                            to give effect to your wishes for distribution of
                            your property when you die. If there is marital
                            property that’s located abroad you may also need
                            to make a foreign will to deal with those assets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is not a “standard” form of prenuptial
                            agreement in England, because in English law
                            marriage does not alter the ownership of property.
                            This is unlike some countries, including many
                            European countries where marriage will create a
                            “community of property” unless there is a
                            pre-nuptial agreement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because the question of what is fair varies so
                            much from couple to couple, pre-nuptial agreements
                            have to be carefully drafted to fit individual
                            circumstances.

                            Everyone’s situation is unique, but we do offer
                            some “standard” types of agreement should your
                            situation come within their scope. If you contact
                            us we will send you our Basic Information Form,
                            and when you return that to us we can do an
                            initial estimate as to the probable cost of
                            preparing a pre-nuptial agreement for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We also ask that clients who require a pre-nuptial
                            agreement contact us at least 8 weeks prior to the
                            wedding day so the necessary work can be completed
                            in time. Usually prenups should be signed well in
                            advance of marriage so that there can be no
                            suggestion that one party entered the agreement
                            under duress. Most couples are busy enough anyway
                            in the weeks immediately prior to the big day.
                            However, if you are due to marry in less than 8
                            weeks’ time you still have the option for us to
                            draft your post-nuptial agreement if required.

                            <strong>Do you offer wills as well?</strong><br />
                            Yes, we recommend making wills to dovetail with
                            the agreement. As with proposed agreements, we can
                            assess if we can offer a fixed fee for one of our
                            standard wills, or whether more complicated
                            drafting is needed.

                            <strong>Aren’t prenups unromantic?</strong><br />
                            You are getting married to signal a long-term
                            commitment and as you might expect, there will be
                            plenty of unromantic decisions to make in the
                            course of your marriage. For some couples without
                            pre-nuptial agreements, the uncertainly of their
                            financial set-up can cause underlying and
                            long-term issues. Isn’t it better to start with a
                            concrete financial plan so both of you know where
                            you stand?

              <h4>The Scenario</h4>

              <p>
              Mr P saw us about whether a pre-nuptial would be
              appropriate. He was a business man with substantial
              assets in England. He was entering into an arranged
              marriage with a distant relative who was a company
              executive.
              </p>
              <p>
              Whilst they naturally hoped it would work they both
              wanted to realistically consider what would happen if it
              did not.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div class="inner reply">
              <h4>Our Solution</h4>

              <p>
              We advised on an agreement which preserved their
              individual property except for the property which was to
              be their home. We then built in a formula that if they
              had children it would provide more generously for the
              future Mrs P. Finally, if the marriage lasted more than
              7 years the agreement was to end and the ordinary law
              would apply. His fiance was independently advised and
              agreed to the deal. We are pleased to confirm that Mr
              and Mrs P have had a happy marriage.
