                    <p>
                        We are specialist international divorce lawyers and family solicitors. Over
                        the years we have worked on countless international divorces, including
                        those where consideration of US or Canadian family law has been necessary.
                        This could be because one or both spouses are UK–based but originate from
                        Canada or the USA, or because either husband or wife is living in the US or
                        Canada but have a legal connection to the UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the US courts have authority or jurisdiction to decide issues about your
                        children and finances when you divorce, the eventual outcome will largely be
                        dictated by the particular State in which your divorce case is heard. That’s
                        because individual States – not the federal government – &nbsp;have the
                        power to issue decrees of divorce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the rules about child arrangements, alimony and financial
                        settlements differ considerably from state to state it’s crucial to get
                        advice from a specialist international solicitor. When it comes to divorce
                        laws in the USA, the team at Brookman is well aware of the specific aspects
                        of family law and how they differ from state to state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of the States in the North East in particular follow the common law
                        model similar to England where the courts aim to achieve an ‘equitable
                        distribution’ of property. Many Southern and Western States on the other
                        hand tend to follow the Community of Property rules derived from continental
                        law where courts start off with the presumption that community property
                        should be divided equally between the spouses. We have dealt with cases
                        decided under the community property regime in States like California,
                        Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, Wisconsin Texas, Washinton State, New
                        Mexico as well as States where property is divided equitably, including New
                        York, Massachusetts, Georgia, New Jersey and Florida.

                    <p>
                        In Canada it’s the federal government that decides matters relating to
                        divorce so, unlike in the USA, the rules about divorce are the same right
                        across the country. Child issues and finance, including spousal support are
                        dealt with by way of so-called corollary relief proceedings. The courts
                        won’t finalise a divorce while corollary relief proceedings are ongoing.

                <h4>The Scenario</h4>

                <p>
                    We were contacted by Mr J, a British Citizen who lived here for some
                    years. Previously he had lived in Canada for several years and
                    married a Canadian citizen who was a dual national. Mr J was engaged
                    and wanted to re-marry but had lost all contact with his current
                    wife.

                <h4>Our Solution</h4>

                <p>
                    We made a number of enquiries in Canada as to the whereabouts of Mrs
                    J using our Canadian agents. Unfortunately she was not traceable and
                    appeared to have left Canada. We then had to show to the Court the
                    extent of our enquiries and provide evidence to the Court that we
                    had made reasonable efforts to find Mrs J. We were able to do this
                    and the Court allowed us to dispense with the requirement to serve
                    papers on Mrs J on the strength of the evidence we provided to the
                    Court. The divorce was then able to proceed allowing Mr J to divorce
                    and re-marry.

                <h3>Financial Settlement</h3>

                <h4>The Scenario</h4>

                <p>
                    Mr and Mrs A were both US citizens but had been in London for 5
                    years. They were separating and had agreed the financial terms. Mrs
                    A was to return to Florida and Mr A to New York. Mrs A was anxious
                    to ensure that the financial terms were enforceable in the US.

                <h4>Our Solution</h4>

                <p>
                    We compared the differing jurisdictional grounds between England,
                    New York and Florida. State laws govern marriage and divorce in the
                    US so separate enquiries had to be made. We then drafted the
                    agreement in terms which would be accepted in the US.
