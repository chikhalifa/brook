                    <p>
                      <span data-contrast="auto"
                        >From its inception divorce has been a procedure
                        associated with blame and fault. In England and Wales
                        this is borne out by The Matrimonial Causes Act, 1973
                        the statute that regulates divorce. Under the
                        legislation separating couples must establish one of
                        five grounds to divorce – three of which involve blaming
                        the other spouse. As society has evolved, criticism has
                        grown about this need to prove fault to end a marriage –
                        not least because it raises the possibility of
                        additional conflict in what may be an already fractious
                        relationship. Following many years of political lobbying
                        and pressure the first divorces under the no-fault
                        procedure are set to begin in England and Wales on 6
                        April 2022. </span

                        >In practice the no-fault divorce procedure is geared
                        toward more efficient, less acrimonious divorce cases.
                        In particular the removal of the ability of either side
                        to contest proceedings will reduce the likelihood of
                        expensive, contested court applications cropping up
                        throughout the process. It’s also hoped there will be
                        less of an impact on children and the wider family as
                        divorce becomes a less contentious issue. When the
                        opportunity for bitter disputes over personal matters is
                        reduced, couples can concentrate more productively on
                        reaching a fair financial settlement. </span

                          If you and your spouse or civil partner are clear in
                          your own minds that you wish to divorce and that
                          obtaining the decree will be uncontentious then there
                          is little point in waiting until 6 April. The new
                          rules are geared above all toward reducing acrimony.
                          If none exists and the parties agree the marriage has
                          broken down then the current rules are an effective
                          way to dissolve your marriage. Even if you do have to
                          invoke one of the fault-based reasons to obtain your
                          decree nisi, you could – like many couples in these
                          circumstances – treat this as a formality. The grounds
                          you cite for divorce will have no impact whatsoever on
                          your financial settlement or how your children will be
                          looked after following your divorce.</span

                          If you want to get divorced sooner rather than later,
                          waiting for no-fault divorce to come in may not be
                          advisable. Under the new rules there is a minimum 20
                          week period of refle This is calculated from the date
                          the application for a divorce order is made. There is
                          then a further six -week waiting period between the
                          conditional order of divorce and the final order. If
                          your divorce is not going to be contested and the
                          issues around your children and finances are
                          relatively unproblematic you may wish to issue a
                          petition immediately rather than wait until 6 April
                          2022.</span

                          what some anticipate will be an upsurge in petitions
                          on 6 April 2022, exacerbating the existing delays in
                          the divorce court system. </span

                          Even if you decide to wait for no-fault divorce you
                          and your spouse or civil partner could, with the
                          assistance of your legal advisers, use the intervening
                          period to reach an agreement on finances and
                          arrangements for children. Although you won’t be able
                          to formalise any agreement until you obtain your
                          conditional order of divorce, a lot of the legwork can
                          be done ahead of time ensuring that once the rules
                          come into effect, you can obtain your divorce as
                          efficiently as possible.  It’s essential to review any
                          informal agreement reached in this way before it gets
                          judicial approval. That way you can satisfy yourself
                          that assets like property and pensions have retained
                          the values ascribed to them during your negotiations
                          with your spouse or civil partner.</span

                          If your partner is likely to contest your divorce or

                          April 2022 on a fault basis, it is probably best to
                          wait until the new regime comes into effect. At that
                          point your spouse won’t be able to raise objections to
                          your application.</span
