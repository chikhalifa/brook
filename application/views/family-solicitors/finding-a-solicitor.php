                            You don’t choose your lawyer to be your friend. You choose him/her to be
                            your committed advocate and sympathetic adviser. Your lawyer should be the
                            one person you can rely on to steadfastly look after your interests. Look at
                            advertisements. The Yellow Pages is a good place to start. Search for those
                            who hold themselves out as specialists. Lawyers who mix divorce in with
                            other work are unlikely to have either the experience or the commitment to
                            look after you properly.

                            Check out websites, this will tell you a lot more about their style and the
                            kind of operation they run. Then phone them up and ask about a first
                            interview. Many people think they would prefer a lawyer of their own gender.
                            Other clients have no preferences whether they see a man or woman. In our
                            experience the gender of the lawyer ceases to be an issue within 5 minutes.
                            A good lawyer is a good lawyer and no-one has shown that having a male or a
                            female lawyer makes any difference to client satisfaction or to results.

                        <h2 id="heading0">1. Choose a specialist</h2>
                        <p>
                            Avoid firms who refer you to their “Litigation Department”, this often mixes
                            everything concerning court work together. Firms that specialise solely in
                            Family Law are better equipped to recognise the legal issues in your case.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="heading1">2. Approaching the firm</h2>
                        <p>
                            You will first need to telephone the firm to discuss making an appointment.
                            You will usually be asked to give a brief summary of your situation to
                            ensure they can assist you and that your case does not involve some
                            sub-speciality they do not practice, such as child abduction and
                            other&nbsp;<a
                            href="<?= base_url('childrens-issues') ?>"
                            >child issues</a
                            >. All information you give is confidential. If the firm is able to assist
                            in your matter you will then come in for an interview, alternatively if you
                            are unable to do so an interview can be conducted by telephone. The
                            reception you receive will help you decide if you want to continue
                            discussions. If you are told you can make an appointment a fortnight ahead,
                            but are unable to have a preliminary talk to a lawyer, or worse the
                            preliminary talk is charged for, it is not a good omen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You should be able to give a clear picture of your situation without being
                            charged for it. On the other hand, a free first interview is generally worth
                            precisely what you pay for it – nothing!Find out what the first interview
                            will cost, and how long it is expected to take, and what, if anything you
                            will need to bring with you. In our experience it usually takes the best
                            part of an hour to get all the facts and explain the various options to a
                            potential new client. You are unlikely to find a specialist lawyer at much
                            under 200 per hour, so be prepared to pay according to your individual
                            circumstances.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="heading2">3. The First Interview</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is where you will know if you have selected the right lawyer. You
                            should come away from the interview knowing what the law says in your
                            situation, what your options are and what steps you need to be thinking
                            about. By the end of the interview you should have a “road map” of where you
                            are going, and an idea of the general options and costs. Quite often this
                            will be all a client wants at that stage. Around half our clients come to
                            our firm for just that, this allows them to leave knowing exactly where they
                            stand.A face to face interview is not always possible. Some of our clients
                            live overseas, but we achieve the same effect by telephone calls and email.

                        <h2 id="heading3">4. Your Divorce Lawyer</h2>
                        <p>
                            Do remember your divorce lawyer can only give legal solutions and legal
                            solutions are not appropriate to all human conflict. Very often, you will be
                            concurrently talking over the issues – or arguing over the issues – with
                            your former partner. There is not much point in telephoning your lawyer to
                            complain that your spouse is so obstinate he/she will not give an inch. The
                            lawyer probably has worked that out already, which is why he or she
                            recommended court proceedings as the means of getting a solution. But you
                            can and should expect them to hear out your emotions as well as your
                            instructions. For example, if you are considering giving away more in
                            negotiations than your lawyer has recommended, your lawyer needs to know the
                            reasons why you are thinking of doing that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Often mothers will do that because they hope it will lessen their husbands’
                            aggression from the breakdown of the marriage, and so improve things for the
                            children. Men may be feeling guilty. Your lawyer needs to hear that, and you
                            need to hear your lawyer’s advice as to whether that is realistic. When you
                            give instructions to your lawyer, things should start to happen. You should
                            keep copies of correspondence and documentation and be informed about what
                            is happening next. You must keep your lawyer updated with your
                            circumstances. Henry Brookman was presenting a husband’s divorce in court
                            one morning when the judge said politely “Perhaps you could look behind you
                            at your client and take some fresh instructions”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The client and his wife were wrapped in each other’s arms, sobbing; and they
                            walked out of court as a reconciled pair of lovebirds. Warning signs of a
                            solicitor who is not keeping you adequately informed is failure to answer
                            your letters, return your telephone calls, but instead summoning you in for
                            a face–to–face discussion. If after the first interview you simply feel the
                            lawyer is not for you, then do not have any reservations in changing to
                            another lawyer.
                        </p>
                        <h2 id="heading4">5. Personality</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some lawyers have reputations as aggressive fighters, and others as mild
                            mannered conciliators. A good divorce lawyer will be able to wear both hats.
                            There is no “one size fits all” solution. You may have a tough-minded and
                            aggressive partner who takes a delight in the idea of a court showdown. If
                            so, your lawyer should be able to give him that with interest. But more
                            often it is a matter of the lawyer persisting in getting some facts and
                            figures, perhaps applying a bit of pressure, perhaps giving your partner
                            time to catch up, and then opening up a firm but amicable negotiation.
