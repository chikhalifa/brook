              <h3>Who Can Apply For Child Arrangements Orders?</h3>
              <p>
                Either parent can apply for orders relating to children as well
                as anyone with
                <a

                >
                for the child. Sometimes grandparents or other relatives ask us
                if they can apply for child arrangements orders. The answer is
                that they can but they need to clear an extra hurdle first by
                seeking the permission of the court to do so.

              <h3>
                Can I Use Mediation To Settle Disputes About The Children?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Yes. Most child issues are settled through negotiation and
                mediation. Court is often seen as a last resort. The mediation
                process is less formal than the court process and many of our
                clients report that they find mediation less stressful than the
                idea of going to court. Agreeing arrangements also gives you
                more of a sense of control over the issues. And it’s possible to
                formalise anything you agree with your ex spouse through
                mediation by making the agreement part of a Consent Order.  Once
                you get this approved by a family judge it’s legally binding.

                Do we have to go to Court to decide what will happen to the
                children?
              </h3>
              <p>
                No, in almost all cases this is not required. Typically, the
                parents agree and often formalise the arrangement with the
                assistance of their lawyer. Where parents agree there is usually
                no need for any court order at all. If the parents cannot agree
                it would then become a matter for the Court to decide.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Normally the non-resident parent will be able to agree to see
                their child on significant dates and occasions. This can either
                be agreed informally with the other parent but if there is a
                dispute then the non-resident parent could apply for a court
                order.

              <h3>Can I take my child to live abroad after divorce?</h3>
              <p>
                Permission will be required from the other parent or via a court
                order. Taking your child abroad for longer than a holiday would
                be considered abduction and the other parent could apply to the
                Child Abduction Unit to have your child brought home.

              <p>
                If the step-parent has taken the role of parent during the
                marriage and their ex-spouse (the biological parent) is not able
                to provide for the child, the step-parent may then be required
                to pay child maintenance.  Whilst it is typical for the child’s
                biological parent to gain residence, this is not always the
                case. It will depend on how capable the parents are to provide
                for the child what is in the child’s best interests.

                Does the CMS (formerly the CSA) have to be involved in deciding

              </h3>
              <p>
                No. Whilst you may use a CMS calculation to aid with deciding a
                maintenance payment figure, it is then common for a private
                maintenance agreement to be set up by your lawyers. The CMS or
                court do not then need to be involved. If required, 12 months
                from the agreement, the CMS can become involved if either party
                wishes it.

                Changing your child’s surname would require the other parent’s
                written consent or a court order.

                Will the family home be retained for the child to live in?
              </h3>
              <p>
                If it is in the best interests of the child to remain in the
                family home with one of the parents it is possible that the
                court will order the home to be retained for a set length of
                time.

              <h3>Can I move with my child to another part of the UK?</h3>
              <p>
                If you are the resident parent, you do not need the other
                parent’s permission to move with your child within the UK.
                However, the other parent could request a court order preventing
                you from moving whilst the situation is looked at in more
                detail. In making a decision as to the child’s living
                arrangements, the court will always look first at what is in the
                best interests of the child.

              <h3>Can I take my child abroad on holiday?</h3>
              <p>
                If you have a court order setting out that the child is to live
                with you then you do not need ask permission from the other
                parent to go on holiday abroad for up to 28 days. If you do not
                have a court order, you will require the permission of the other
                parent. If the other parent will not give permission, you can
                apply for an order to go on holiday with the child.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Typically no. However, if you have good reason to be concerned
                about your child’s welfare with regard to your ex’s new partner,
                you could apply for conditions to be imposed upon the existing
                contact arrangements.

              <p>
                If the child is old enough and has sufficient understanding to
                state a preference, the court will take into account their
                wishes. It is however unlikely that the child will simply be
                asked to choose because it is an unfair question and the reasons
                behind a child’s answer may be mixed. The court will however
                also consider wider factors, including each parent’s ability to
                meet the child’s needs, the child’s safety and how the new
                change in circumstances may affect the child.
