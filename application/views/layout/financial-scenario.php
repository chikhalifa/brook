            <h4>The Scenario</h4>

            <p>
            Mrs G left the home last year due to her husband's
            alcoholism. The home is in his name and he refuses to
            co-operate. He works as a Sales Director and has a large
            pension accumulated from fifteen years with his
            employer.

            <p>
            Mrs G petitioned for divorce on the basis of her
            husband's unreasonable behaviour. At the same time we
            filed a financial application. When Mr G failed to make
            financial disclosure we obtained an Order requiring him
            to do so in 14 days or risk imprisonment for contempt of
            Court.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was made clear that if he did not co-operate then the
            Court would make Orders giving Mrs G her share anyway
            and if necessary Mrs G would be given power to sell the
            house and to evict him. Mr G then settled the case.

            <h3>Scenario Analysis Example #2</h3>

            <h4>The Scenario</h4>

            <p>
            In 1980 Mr G aged 25 was living with his partner.  When
            she became pregnant he made a Will making her the
            executor and leaving everything to her.  They separated
            2 years later.  The child is now adult.  He re-partnered
            and had 1 child but the relationship again ended after 2
            years.  He continued paying his ex partner’s rent rather
            than go through the Child Support Agency.  
            </p>
            <p>
            He met his third partner in 1994 and they had 3
            children.  He died in 2010.  He had never made another
            Will or revoked the one made in 1980, but he had quite
            substantial assets by the time of his death.  What
            rights did his ex- partners and 4 children have?

            <h4>Our Solution</h4>

            <p>
            Briefly, Mr G left a huge mess.  His ex-partners
            challenged the Will in the Courts.  The dependent
            children had claims.  Did the adult son, who was
            independent and 28 years old, have a claim?  What rights
            did the mothers have where they were left supporting
            children under 18?
            </p>
            <p>
            Ultimately a judge had to decide on the balance of
            fairness between the minor children bearing in mind the
            available resources.  His first partner and adult child
            did not receive anything.  The cost of sorting this out
            used almost half the estate.The moral is, make a Will!
