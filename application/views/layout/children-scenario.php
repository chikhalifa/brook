          <h3>Scenario Analysis Example #1</h3>

          <h4>The Scenario</h4>

          <p>
            Mr and Mrs H separated. Mr H moved a few streets away and their
            eldest boy (now 15) lived with him. The younger children (14 and 12)
            stayed with Mrs H but the children live near each other and attend
            the same school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs H remarried and wishes to move to her new husband's city. Mr H
            sought advice about residence of the other children. He told us the
            middle child wanted to stay at school with his friends.

          <h4>Our Solution</h4>

          <p>
            There is no set age at which a child can "choose". Nevertheless in
            reality it would be hard for Mrs H to resist the 14 year old's
            wishes. We needed to be careful not to stress the children. Rather
            than issuing proceedingswe arranged mediation for Mr and Mrs H to
            discuss the issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            We advised Mr H to be flexible regarding contact. They reached an
            amicable arrangement for all children to live with Mr H for the
            school week and half weekends; and flexible school holiday
            arrangements.
